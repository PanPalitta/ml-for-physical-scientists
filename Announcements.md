# Announcement

* [01-21-2021] Video lecture 2 is shared [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1urRjPvKjLZU3QgEDolsQIoC2gssWHB3j?usp=sharing), and the workshop lecture is kindly prepared by Krittin [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1D72xllKe4zZxsA72R7srdMr6NTIt2xgx?usp=sharing). Please finish all these videos and feel free to post your questions to discuss on Monday on facebook page! 

* [01-19-2021] Video lecture 0 and 1 are shared on [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1urRjPvKjLZU3QgEDolsQIoC2gssWHB3j?usp=sharing). The accompanying slides are uploaded on GitHub [here](https://github.com/TChotibut/ml-for-physical-scientists/tree/main/Lecture%20Notes). Statistical Learning Theory is deep and sophisticated, please spend time thinking about concepts in lecture 1. A mathematically oriented student might also appreciate the formulation of supervised learning in the classic paper [F. Cucker and S. Smale, On the mathematical foundations of learning, Bulletin of the American Mathematical Society, 2002.](https://github.com/TChotibut/ml-for-physical-scientists/blob/main/Reading%20Materials/Week1_Cucker_Smale_Mathematical%20Foundations%20of%20Learning.pdf)

* [01-17-2021] Readings for week 1-2: Mehta's section 1-8.  **Preliminary homework 0** [here](https://github.com/sinonkt/ml-for-physical-scientists/blob/main/Homework/HW0_ML%20can%20be%20difficult.ipynb) (due Friday January 22) requires you to install Jupyter notebook and relevant packages such as sklearn on your local computer.  You'll get your hands dirty and get intuition why Machine Learning can be difficult. 

* [01-14-2021] Unless announced here or on the [facebook group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/1033694817095022), we will virtually meet every Monday from 11.00am-noon on [Zoom](https://chula.zoom.us/j/5943943895?pwd=dmpxc3NBMXFPam1FeGtTY2tsdm95UT09) ( Password: MLPhys ). In addition to the weekly virtual meeting, attendances are expected to learn privately at their convenience from the videos to be posted in the announcement ( 2-hour weekly lectures ). The purpose of the virtual meeting is to stimulate the discussion among attendances, as well as to have an interactive session in which questions or comments about lectures and problem sets shall be discussed.
